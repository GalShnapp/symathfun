# An epic notebook App!
this project aims to eventually set up a react front end that evaluates your math while you do it.

more info will be later added, but here are some useful links:
* [Mathpix API ref.](https://docs.mathpix.com/#request-parameters) - currently used for ocr.
* [React-sketch-canvas](https://github.com/vinothpandian/react-sketch-canvas/tree/main) - currently used as a base for the client.
* [sympy repo](https://github.com/sympy) - Currently used at the backend for symbolic math operations
* [sympy docs](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html)
* [fastAPI docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) - currently powers up the backend
